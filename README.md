jCodeCollector
==============

jCodeCollector is a simple snippets manager for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux developed by me (Alessandro Cocco) in my free time. 
<br>
Latest stable version (2.5) has been released in January 2011. I have no time to continue the development of jCodeCollector so I released it as open source (September 2012).
<br>
Thanks you all for your interest!

<b>Code quality & comments</b>

I think today I'm a better developer but the code was written when I was n00b. In hindsight code quality is not so good :( I used English for classes, variables and methods but most of the comments are in Italian. Hope it's not a problem ^^'
